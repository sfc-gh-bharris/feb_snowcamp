    "# Getting Started with Snowflake Cortex ML-Based Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most critical activities that a Data/Business Analyst has to perform is to produce recommendations to their business stakeholders based upon the insights they have gleaned from their data. In practice, this means that they are often required to build models to: make forecasts, identify long running trends, and identify abnormalities within their data. However, Analysts are often impeded from creating the best models possible due to the depth of statistical and machine learning knowledge required to implement them in practice. Further, python or other programming frameworks may be unfamiliar to Analysts who write SQL, and the nuances of fine-tuning a model may require expert knowledge that may be out of reach. \n",
    "\n",
    "For these use cases, Snowflake has developed a set of SQL based ML Functions, that implement machine learning models on the user's behalf. We will review three ML Functions that are available for time-series based data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Forecasting: which enables users to forecast a metric based on past values. Common use-cases for forecasting including predicting future sales, demand for particular sku's of an item, or volume of traffic into a website over a period of time.\n",
    "2. Anomaly Detection: which flags anomalous values using both unsupervised and supervised learning methods. This may be useful in use-cases where you want to identify spikes in your cloud spend, identifying abnormal data points in logs, and more.\n",
    "3. Contribution Explorer: which enables users to perform root cause analysis to determine the most significant drivers to a particular metric of interest. \n",
    "\n",
    "For further details on ML Functions, please refer to the [snowflake documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/guides-overview-analysis). \n",
    "\n",
    "Snowflake Cortex gives you instant access to industry-leading large language models (LLMs) trained by researchers at companies like Anthropic, Mistral, Reka, Meta, and Google, including Snowflake Arctic, an open enterprise-grade model developed by Snowflake.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because these LLMs are fully hosted and managed by Snowflake, using them requires no setup. Your data stays within Snowflake, giving you the performance, scalability, and governance you expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Snowflake Cortex features are provided as SQL functions and are also available in Python. Cortex LLM Functions can be grouped into the following categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "* COMPLETE function\n",
    "* Task-specific functions\n",
    "* Helper functions\n",
    "\n",
    "### COMPLETE function\n",
    "\n",
    "The COMPLETE function is a general purpose function that can perform a wide range of user-specified tasks, such as aspect-based sentiment classification, synthetic data generation, and customized summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cortex Guard is an option of the COMPLETE function that filters possible unsafe and harmful responses from a language model. You can also use this function with your fine-tuned models\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task-specific functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Task-specific functions are purpose-built and managed functions that automate routine tasks, like simple summaries and quick translations, that don’t require any customization.\n",
    "\n",
    "CLASSIFY_TEXT: Given a piece of text, classifies it into one of the categories that you define.\n",
    "\n",
    "EXTRACT_ANSWER: Given a question and unstructured data, returns the answer to the question if it can be found in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "PARSE_DOCUMENT: Given an internal or external stage with documents, returns an object that contains extracted text content using OCR mode, or the extracted text and layout elements using LAYOUT mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "SENTIMENT: Returns a sentiment score, from -1 to 1, representing the detected positive or negative sentiment of the given text.\n",
    "\n",
    "SUMMARIZE: Returns a summary of the given text.\n",
    "\n",
    "TRANSLATE: Translates given text from any supported language to any other.\n",
    "\n",
    "EMBED_TEXT_768: Given a piece of text, returns a vector embedding of 768 dimensions that represents that text.\n",
    "\n",
    "EMBED_TEXT_1024: Given a piece of text, returns a vector embedding of 1024 dimensions that represents that text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Helper functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Helper functions are purpose-built and managed functions that reduce cases of failures when running other LLM functions, for example by getting the count of tokens in an input prompt to ensure the call doesn’t exceed a model limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "COUNT_TOKENS: Given an input text, returns the token count based on the model or Cortex function specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "TRY_COMPLETE: Works like the COMPLETE function, but returns NULL when the function could not execute instead of an error code."

When the ESP people use a phrase like that, they\\'re referring to the sensation of the mind actually leaving the body and spiriting itself off to China or Peoria or a galaxy far, far away. When I use the phrase, I simply mean that my imagination has forgotten it is actually present in a movie theater and thinks it\\'s up there on the screen. In a curious sense, the events in the movie seem real, and I seem to be a part of them. \n",
    "\n",
    "“Star Wars” works like that. My list of other out-of-the-body films is a short and odd one, ranging from the artistry of “Bonnie and Clyde” or “Cries and Whispers” to the slick commercialism of “Jaws” and the brutal strength of “Taxi Driver.” On whatever level (sometimes I\\'m not at all sure) they engage me so immediately and powerfully that I lose my detachment, my analytical reserve. The movie\\'s happening, and it\\'s happening to me.\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes the “Star Wars” experience unique, though, is that it happens on such an innocent and often funny level. It\\'s usually violence that draws me so deeply into a movie — violence ranging from the psychological torment of a Bergman character to the mindless crunch of a shark\\'s jaws. Maybe movies that scare us find the most direct route to our imaginations. But there\\'s hardly any violence at all in “Star Wars” (and even then it\\'s presented as essentially bloodless swashbuckling). Instead, there\\'s entertainment so direct and simple that all of the complications of the modern movie seem to vaporize.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Star Wars” is a fairy tale, a fantasy, a legend, finding its roots in some of our most popular fictions. The golden robot, lion-faced space pilot, and insecure little computer on wheels must have been suggested by the Tin Man, the Cowardly Lion, and the Scarecrow in “The Wizard of Oz.” The journey from one end of the galaxy to another is out of countless thousands of space operas. The hardware is from “Flash Gordon” out of “2001: A Space Odyssey,” the chivalry is from Robin Hood, the heroes are from Westerns and the villains are a cross between Nazis and sorcerers. “Star Wars” taps the pulp fantasies buried in our memories, and because it\\'s done so brilliantly, it reactivates old thrills, fears, and exhilarations we thought we\\'d abandoned when we read our last copy of Amazing Stories.The movie works so well for several reasons, and they don\\'t all have to do with the spectacular special effects. The effects are good, yes, but great effects have been used in such movies as “Silent Running” and “Logan\\'s Run” without setting all-time box-office records. No, I think the key to “Star Wars” is more basic than that.\n",
    "\n",
    "The movie relies on the strength of pure narrative, in the most basic storytelling form known to man, the Journey. All of the best tales we remember from our childhoods had to do with heroes setting out to travel down roads filled with danger, and hoping to find treasure or heroism at the journey\\'s end. In “Star Wars,” George Lucas takes this simple and powerful framework into outer space, and that is an inspired thing to do, because we no longer have maps on Earth that warn, “Here there be dragons.” We can\\'t fall off the edge of the map, as Columbus could, and we can\\'t hope to find new continents of prehistoric monsters or lost tribes ruled by immortal goddesses. Not on Earth, anyway, but anything is possible in space, and Lucas goes right ahead and shows us very nearly everything. We get involved quickly, because the characters in “Star Wars” are so strongly and simply drawn and have so many small foibles and large, futile hopes for us to identify with. And then Lucas does an interesting thing. As he sends his heroes off to cross the universe and do battle with the Forces of Darth Vader, the evil Empire, and the awesome Death Star, he gives us lots of special effects, yes — ships passing into hyperspace, alien planets, an infinity of stars — but we also get a wealth of strange living creatures, and Lucas correctly guesses that they\\'ll be more interesting for us than all the intergalactic hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most fascinating single scene, for me, was the one set in the bizarre saloon on the planet Tatooine. As that incredible collection of extraterrestrial alcoholics and bug-eyed martini drinkers lined up at the bar, and as Lucas so slyly let them exhibit characteristics that were universally human, I found myself feeling a combination of admiration and delight. “Star Wars” had placed me in the presence of really magical movie invention: Here, all mixed together, were whimsy and fantasy, simple wonderment and quietly sophisticated storytelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "When Stanley Kubrick was making “2001” in the late 1960s, he threw everything he had into the special effects depicting outer space, but he finally decided not to show any aliens at all — because they were impossible to visualize, he thought.

    "SELECT SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.EXTRACT_ANSWER('Every once in a while I have what I think of as an out-of-the-body experience at a movie. When the ESP people use a phrase like that, they\\'re referring to the sensation of the mind actually leaving the body and spiriting itself off to China or Peoria or a galaxy far, far away. When I use the phrase, I simply mean that my imagination has forgotten it is actually present in a movie theater and thinks it\\'s up there on the screen. In a curious sense, the events in the movie seem real, and I seem to be a part of them. \n",
    "\n",
    "“Star Wars” works like that. My list of other out-of-the-body films is a short and odd one, ranging from the artistry of “Bonnie and Clyde” or “Cries and Whispers” to the slick commercialism of “Jaws” and the brutal strength of “Taxi Driver.” On whatever level (sometimes I\\'m not at all sure) they engage me so immediately and powerfully that I lose my detachment, my analytical reserve. The movie\\'s happening, and it\\'s happening to me.\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes the “Star Wars” experience unique, though, is that it happens on such an innocent and often funny level. It\\'s usually violence that draws me so deeply into a movie — violence ranging from the psychological torment of a Bergman character to the mindless crunch of a shark\\'s jaws. Maybe movies that scare us find the most direct route to our imaginations. But there\\'s hardly any violence at all in “Star Wars” (and even then it\\'s presented as essentially bloodless swashbuckling). Instead, there\\'s entertainment so direct and simple that all of the complications of the modern movie seem to vaporize.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Star Wars” is a fairy tale, a fantasy, a legend, finding its roots in some of our most popular fictions. The golden robot, lion-faced space pilot, and insecure little computer on wheels must have been suggested by the Tin Man, the Cowardly Lion, and the Scarecrow in “The Wizard of Oz.” The journey from one end of the galaxy to another is out of countless thousands of space operas. The hardware is from “Flash Gordon” out of “2001: A Space Odyssey,” the chivalry is from Robin Hood, the heroes are from Westerns and the villains are a cross between Nazis and sorcerers. “Star Wars” taps the pulp fantasies buried in our memories, and because it\\'s done so brilliantly, it reactivates old thrills, fears, and exhilarations we thought we\\'d abandoned when we read our last copy of Amazing Stories.The movie works so well for several reasons, and they don\\'t all have to do with the spectacular special effects. The effects are good, yes, but great effects have been used in such movies as “Silent Running” and “Logan\\'s Run” without setting all-time box-office records. No, I think the key to “Star Wars” is more basic than that.\n",
    "\n",
    "The movie relies on the strength of pure narrative, in the most basic storytelling form known to man, the Journey. All of the best tales we remember from our childhoods had to do with heroes setting out to travel down roads filled with danger, and hoping to find treasure or heroism at the journey\\'s end. In “Star Wars,” George Lucas takes this simple and powerful framework into outer space, and that is an inspired thing to do, because we no longer have maps on Earth that warn, “Here there be dragons.” We can\\'t fall off the edge of the map, as Columbus could, and we can\\'t hope to find new continents of prehistoric monsters or lost tribes ruled by immortal goddesses. Not on Earth, anyway, but anything is possible in space, and Lucas goes right ahead and shows us very nearly everything. We get involved quickly, because the characters in “Star Wars” are so strongly and simply drawn and have so many small foibles and large, futile hopes for us to identify with. And then Lucas does an interesting thing. As he sends his heroes off to cross the universe and do battle with the Forces of Darth Vader, the evil Empire, and the awesome Death Star, he gives us lots of special effects, yes — ships passing into hyperspace, alien planets, an infinity of stars — but we also get a wealth of strange living creatures, and Lucas correctly guesses that they\\'ll be more interesting for us than all the intergalactic hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most fascinating single scene, for me, was the one set in the bizarre saloon on the planet Tatooine. As that incredible collection of extraterrestrial alcoholics and bug-eyed martini drinkers lined up at the bar, and as Lucas so slyly let them exhibit characteristics that were universally human, I found myself feeling a combination of admiration and delight. “Star Wars” had placed me in the presence of really magical movie invention: Here, all mixed together, were whimsy and fantasy, simple wonderment and quietly sophisticated storytelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "When Stanley Kubrick was making “2001” in the late 1960s, he threw everything he had into the special effects depicting outer space, but he finally decided not to show any aliens at all — because they were impossible to visualize, he thought. But they weren\\'t at all, as “Star Wars” demonstrates, and the movie\\'s delight in the possibilities of alien life forms is at least as much fun as its conflicts between the space cruisers of the Empire and the Rebels.\n",
    "\n",
    "And perhaps that helps to explain the movie\\'s one weakness, which is that the final assault on the Death Star is allowed to go on too long. Maybe, having invested so much money and sweat in his special effects, Lucas couldn\\'t bear to see them trimmed.

    "Some considerations to keep in mind from the above code: \n",
    "1. **Use the freshest data available**: In the code above, we used `vancouver_anomaly_analysis_set` to retrain the model, which, because the data is static, would contain the same data as the original model. In a production setting, you may accordingly adjust the input table/view to have the most updated dataset to retrain the model.\n",
    "2. **Sending emails**: This requires you to set up an integration, and specify who the recipients of the email should be. When completed appropriately, you'll recieve an email from `no-reply@snowflake.net`, as seen below. \n",
    "3. **Formatting results**: We've made use of a snowpark stored procedure, to take advantage of the functions that pandas has to neatly present the resultset into an email. For futher details and options, refer to this [medium post](https://medium.com/snowflake/hey-snowflake-send-me-an-email-243741a0fe3) by Felipe Hoffa.\n",
    "4. **Executing the Tasks**: We have set this task to run the first of every month - if you would like to run it immediately, you'll have to change the state of the task to `RESUME` as shown in the last three lines of code above, before executing the parent task `AD_VANCOUVER_TRAINING_TASK`. Note that we have orchestrated the task to send the email to the user *after* the model has been retrained. After executing, you may expect to see an email similar to the one below within a few minutes.\n"

    "\n",
    "**You did it!** Congrats on building your first set of models using Snowflake Cortex ML-Based Functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a review, in this guide we covered how you are able to: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Acquire holiday data from the snowflake marketplace\n",
    "- Visualized sales data from our fitictious company Tasty Bytes\n",
    "- Built out forecasting model for only a single item (Lobster Mac & Cheese), before moving onto a multi-series forecast for all the food items sold in Vancouver\n",
    "- Used Anomaly detection ML Function to identify anomalous sales, and used it to understand recent trends in sales data\n",
    "- Productionize pipelines using Tasks & Stored Procedures, so you can get the latest results from your model on a regular cadence\n",
