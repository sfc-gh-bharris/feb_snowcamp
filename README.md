# feb_snowcamp

This repository has all of the notebooks, streamlit apps, worksheets and setup scripts you will need to participate in the Febuary Snowcamp.

To get started, sign up for a Snowflake Trial account.

Once you've done that, you need to copy the contents of setup.sql into a worksheet in Snowflake, run all and it will set everything up.
